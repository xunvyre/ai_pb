# Basic Marketing Website
for Amelia Island Peterbrooke

## Purpose
This website was designed as a simple landing page to show off to clients during marketing campaigns.
The primary use of this site is to show off a collection of items for sale, while also providing interesting information about the location and the family that owns it.
Branding and other design elements had to align with previously established corporate branding, while still highlighting the unique aspects of the Amelia Island location.

## Future Development
In the future, the client will be able to upload pictures themself, rather than having to rely on updates to the hardcoded images.
